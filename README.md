**Description:**

  In this project we create a databse for a doctor's office using SQL. The database tracks the data of patients and doctors. This 
  database is normalized to the third form. The "Project Description.pdf" contains all the information on how the data should be
  sorted. The "Project Answers.pdf" contains all the answers to how to sort the database in SQL. XAMPP and PHP is used to link the
  database to webpages for easy viewing. "q2/3/4.php" in the Database Webpages folder are referenced on the page and will run a 
  SQL script to display the corresponding data requested.
  
**How to Run:**
  1. Download Zip folder.
  2. Go into XAMPP and then the htdocs directory.
  3. Extract files.
  4. Open head.php to see the webpage and click each question to see output.
  
**XAMPP Installation Guide**
  Step 1: Install XAMPP.  [Download from here](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).

  Step 2: Set up XAMPP.  [Follow instructions here](http://sustainablewebdesign.com/book/resources/xampp/).

  Step 3: Go to PhpMyAdmin and create any relevant MySQL tables, if any.

  Step 4: Change the password for PhpMyAdmin (login to PhpMyAdmin, and click “Users” at the top).

  Step 5: [Get unlocked out from PhpMyAdmin](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18807100/locked-out-of-phpmyadmin-with-xampp).

  Step 6: Edit your database access script to [reflect the new PhpMyAdmin credentials](https://community.apachefriends.org/f/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=47691).

  Step 7: Change the temp dir in the php.ini file to point to a directory that’s writable.  (See: [How to edit php.ini](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6185319/how-do-i-edit-php-ini-file-in-xampp-server) and [some more ideas on tmp_dir](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6034048/php-ini-setting-upload-tmp-dir).)

  Step 8: If you're having users upload things, make sure your copies of folders where you want uploads to go [are writable](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1070216/how-do-i-make-directory-writable).
